# Bikeability and Walkability Analysis of Trento  

This repository contains geospatial analysis scripts and datasets used to assess the **bikeability** and **walkability** of the city of Trento. The analysis is based on **OpenStreetMap data** and the **Open Data Trento web portal**, utilizing **spatial network analysis** and **urban accessibility metrics**.  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  

The project evaluates **cycling and pedestrian infrastructure** in Trento by computing indicators such as:  
- **Bike lane length and coverage**  
- **Bike parking density**  
- **Natural area proportion** along cycling routes  
- **Point of Interest (POI) density** for accessibility  
- **Average slope** of bike lanes  
- **Walkability metrics**, including **intersection density** and **amenity accessibility**  

These indicators are used to construct a **Bikeability Index** and analyze district-level variations in active mobility.
